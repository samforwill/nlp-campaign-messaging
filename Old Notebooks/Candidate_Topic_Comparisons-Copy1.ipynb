      "We need a Member of Congress who knows this district &amp; has real solutions.\n",

      "What we really need is a fully-funded VA dedicated to serving veterans first.\n",
      " - I am proud to have built my own home in Skamania County, but the reality is that we didn‚Äôt have a choice. Getting approved for a loan is a nightmare and as a young family it was nearly impossible. In Congress, I‚Äôll fight to bring down the cost of living for Washington families.\n",

Got to see some old friends and make <br>some new ones! #PA17\",\"Thanks to all the folks who came out for our <br>#TeamDeluzio office opening party tonight in <br>Coraopolis. Let's win this! @LindseyForPA\",\"Great to tour ATI Brackenridge and spend time <br>with the @steelworkers members whose hard work <br>makes the place run. We have the workers and <br>businesses that know how to make stuff right here <br>in western PA, and I'll always fight for our <br>union manufacturing jobs in #PA17.\",\"We should make stuff here again. Make it with <br>union workers, grow the middle class, and give <br>small businesses a chance against corporate <br>giants who are gouging
