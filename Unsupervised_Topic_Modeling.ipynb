      " - I spent my day learning more about flood, fish passage, and sediment issues on the Toutle River with Cowlitz County Commissioner Dennis Weber. He’s a Republican and I’m not, but that doesn’t mean we can’t work together to fix things. We need leaders who unite us, not divide us. https://t.co/epa3Ds1ItA\n",
      " - In congress, I will take on politicians who try to get between a woman and her doctor and fight to protect abortion rights that the Supreme Court put in jeopardy. It’s more important than ever that mothers like me stand up for our rights.\n",

      "This is what a truly people-powered movement looks like!\n",
      " - Abortion is not a “Democrat issue.” It affects everyone. In rural counties, people like myself have limited access to essential services. I get my water from a well, and I get my internet from a radio tower – but reproductive health care is even more scarce. 1/4\n",

      "What we really need is a fully-funded VA dedicated to serving veterans first.\n",
      " - I am proud to have built my own home in Skamania County, but the reality is that we didn’t have a choice. Getting approved for a loan is a nightmare and as a young family it was nearly impossible. In Congress, I’ll fight to bring down the cost of living for Washington families.\n",
