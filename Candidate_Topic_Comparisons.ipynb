      "What we really need is a fully-funded VA dedicated to serving veterans first.\n",
      " - I am proud to have built my own home in Skamania County, but the reality is that we didn‚Äôt have a choice. Getting approved for a loan is a nightmare and as a young family it was nearly impossible. In Congress, I‚Äôll fight to bring down the cost of living for Washington families.\n",
