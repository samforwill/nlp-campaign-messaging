This cheap stunt is not going to fix our immigration system and it’s downright inhumane.

MAGA Republicans are too busy using people as pawns to actually improve anything for Americans. We need leadership right now, not the antics of high school bullies.

I'll be making three stops to hear your needs and share how my platform can truly address them.  

Connect with me across #WA03 this weekend, it's gonna be a good one.

I'm not afraid to go toe to toe with Joe Kent in a debate over the needs of our district and country. In fact, I can't wait to put our differences on display.

Let’s be clear: Joe Kent wants to privatize the VA. His “plan” would make veterans pay higher costs for lower quality health care. It’s another extremely bad idea from a guy who offers nothing else.

What we really need is a fully-funded VA dedicated to serving veterans first.

Joe Kent will vote for a national ban on abortion and the GOP has made clear that this is a top priority if they have the majority in November. 

Electing pro-choice candidates has never been more important. Join me in this fight!

Thank you,

The choice here in #WA03 is clear: MAGA extremist Joe Kent wants to ban immigration for 20 years and puts white nationalists on his payroll.

Aug 25, 2022
Republicans claim to want personal freedom and limited government, so this should be an important issue to them too. Opponents of abortion rights want to have a say over their own bodies and personal decisions – so why take that right away from others? 3/4

Just learned 
@AP
 has called the race for us! We have won this primary despite being outspent over 10 to 1. #WA03 is looking for change and I will deliver. I will fight to make sure that working families, small businesses, and mothers have the representation they deserve.

You have until 8 pm tonight to turn in your ballots! Thank you to my mother in law for the hat, you all know what to do! #Vote4Mom #flipWA03

If you’re against abortion AND contraception, you’re an extremist. 
@HerreraBeutler
 is out of touch with our district’s values. You can watch my 
@KGWStraighttalk
 interview with

 online or at 7pm tonight on

No matter how much 
@herrerabeutler
 spends on TV ads telling us she’s a moderate her voting record is clear. She’ll take away your right to marry who you love she will take away your right to contraception and freedom of choice. I am the only candidate who will protect our rights.

The stakes couldn’t be higher in this election. We’re running against a field of anti-choice extremists. Join us calling voters across the district to make sure they turn in their ballot before August 2nd. Register to volunteer here: https://marieforcongress.com/volunteer/

So much fun in Pacific County today. Thank you to everyone who came out in Ilwaco & Raymond!

Great turn out at the Camas Days Parade. Thanks to everyone who walked with us & talked to me today!

We’re going to flip #WA03 with the support of folks just like you- thanks to everyone who came out tonight. Looking forward to Camas Days Parade tomorrow!

Feel so relieved after getting my 11 month old son his second shot last Saturday. Thanks to the thousands of patriotic families who volunteered in the trials. Vaccines have been critical for decreasing the spread of covid and preventing hospitalizations, your service saved lives

Jul 21, 2022
Today, 
@HerreraBeutler
 celebrated the end of Roe by voting against a bill to protect our access to contraceptives- one thing we can all agree actually prevents abortion. Jaime is not a moderate and has failed to give #WA03 the representation we deserve.
|

Jul 21, 2022
I am honored to have the endorsement of 
@RepDelBene
! Representative DelBene is a champion for working families, the environment, health care and is a fellow 
@Reed_College_
 alumni! So thankful for her congressional work and value her support.

Help me make sure I can get to Congress to work alongside Suzan by making a contribution today of just $3, $5, $10 or whatever you can!

Jul 19, 2022
Today, renown “moderate”  
@JaimeForUSRep
 voted against codifying a right to same-sex marriage. Who’s rights are up for grabs next?
|

Jul 19, 2022
There is a strong base of Democrats in our district and as a rural democrat who works in the trades, I am the candidate who can flip this seat. Kent is far too extreme & Jaime has been a no-show when we need her the most. SW WA deserves real representation. Let’s flip #WA03
|

Jul 16, 2022
Enjoyed meeting & talking with voters at the Battle Ground Harvest Days Parade this morning. Many thanks to our wonderful volunteers for walking with us!
|

Jul 14, 2022
The numbers are clear, with a united democratic field, we’re making it out of the primary and flipping #WA03! Thank you 
@johnstang_8
  and 
@Crosscut
 for bringing attention to this critical race.
|

Jul 14, 2022
Excellent analysis from 
@daveweigel
 for the 
@washingtonpost
; SW Washington deserves a representative who works for us. When we need Jaime she doesn’t show up. When we rely on her for a critical vote, she’s absent. I will show up and fight for SW Washington

As a proud ally, I want to thank everyone who listened to and spoke with me at Pride in the Park on Saturday. It’s time to fight for all our rights and ensure the LGBTQ community gets the representation it has been missing for the past 12 years! #flipWA03 #MGPforCongress
|

Jul 7, 2022
Hope is the driving force when you’re up against a field of extremist candidates. #WA03 is tired of Jaime Herrera Beutler and Joe Kent is far too extreme for our district. I know we can flip this seat blue! Thank you, 
@OPB
, for telling this story.

I am outraged by today’s Supreme Court decision to reverse Roe v. Wade. 

I, like so many, suffered a miscarriage just two years ago. 
@PPact
 was one of the only places I could turn to get the care I needed, which in this case was an assisted abortion
|

Jun 24, 2022
Without access to safe reproductive care, I could have died or suffered complications that could have prevented me from ever going on to have a successful pregnancy. Without the care Planned Parenthood provided that day, I may not be a mother today.  #WomensRights #RoeVsWade
|

Jun 24, 2022
In congress, I will take on politicians who try to get between a woman and her doctor and fight to protect abortion rights that the Supreme Court put in jeopardy. It’s more important than ever that mothers like me stand up for our rights.
|

Jun 20, 2022
Thanks to everyone who spoke with me at the Juneteenth Festival and to those of you who came to have a beer with me at Hidden House. I’m looking forward to more days like these!

The past two nights have been wonderful! Thank you to the Cowlitz County Democrats and to the 17th LD Democrats for having me.
|

Jun 6, 2022
Such a wonderful Saturday evening at the Cowlitz County Democrats’ Give ‘Em Hell, Harry dinner. Democrats are ready to flip and keep seats blue! I was thankful for the opportunity to speak about the importance of reproductive freedom as the only pro-choice woman on the ballot
|

Proud to receive the OFFICIAL endorsement of the Washington State Labor Council 
@WAAFLCIO
! Now more than ever, its critical that our country has leadership that knows what its like to put in a hard days work and respects the trades that make our country thrive.
|

May 30, 2022
Today we honor those who have lost their lives to preserve our freedoms and protect us all. I am humbled by their sacrifice and grateful for their example. Let us never forget them and work to create a united and just America for all with their legacy in mind 🇺🇸

New Poll Makes Clear that now with united Democratic field, race in November will be between me and White Nationalist, anti-choice Joe Kent.  We can, and must, win.

Ask any economist, this kind of market consolidation is dangerous for consumers everywhere, it just happens that these “consumers” are our most vulnerable children.

I’m honored to receive the endorsement of Rep. Sharon Wylie (49th LD). Sharon has been a leader in the fight for economic, healthcare, and energy reform. I’m fighting hard to join her in this critical work in Congress for WA-03!

May 8, 2022
Happy #Mothersday! The truth is, having a child has lit a fire under me like I’ve never experienced. I’m running for Congress so my son can grow up in an America where the playing field is level, where our rights are respected, and every child has a bright future.
|

May 5, 2022
What a powerful message today from 
@Shut_downAmazon
 in the Senate. I stand with workers’ rights to unionize for fairer pay and better conditions— we need legislation like the PRO Act to hold corporations accountable for retaliating against union organizers.
|

May 2, 2022
It’s clear #SCOTUS respects neither precedent nor women’s basic right to bodily autonomy. It’s more critical than ever that mothers like me fight for our right to determine our future. We must protect our freedoms & stop politicians from taking rights away. Yours could be next.

I’m honored to have the endorsement of Hon. Don Bonker, distinguished former Congressman for WA-03. During his time in public service, he was a champion for working families and the environment. I hope to carry on his legacy representing the same district he once did. #FlipWA03

The Flint water crisis began 8 years ago, and the city is still recovering. Officials are finally being held accountable and the city’s pipes are almost entirely replaced, but the damage done to residents’ trust in their government is irreparable. #CleanWaterForAll

I am honored to have met 
@POTUS
 Biden, on his first trip to the Northwest since being elected. I told him that I own an automotive shop a mile and a half from where we stood -- and I thanked him for the PPP loans that saved jobs at our shop and across the state.
|

Apr 23, 2022
Then, I told 
@POTUS
 that I'm running for Congress in southwest Washington to be a voice for small business owners and workers like me. I could tell he knew I meant it -- I'm going to #FlipWA03 Are you with me? http://marieforcongress.com

Months after we built our home, the Eagle Creek wildfire jumped the Columbia River a couple miles away. We packed to evacuate and held our breath while firefighters battled the fire. We need a Congress who personally understands the dire climate situation we face. #EarthDay2022

Last year, I paid more in taxes than Jeff Bezos, the second-richest person in the country – you read that right. This system doesn’t work for everyday folks. Stand with me to demand a fair tax code that forces the ultra-wealthy to pay their fair share: https://secure.ngpvan.com/rpEHsxFarEiS39oH9kgHlQ2

Like many moms, I've suffered through the heartbreak of miscarriage – imagine the horror of compounding that with being thrown in JAIL. Mothers deserve autonomy, not a police state.
